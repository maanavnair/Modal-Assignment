## Running the application

-clone the repository.\
-run the command: `npm install`.\
-follow the link the website opens up in.

## How the Application works

-You need to enter the Admin ID, Usage and Reason.\
-You can select the Product from the drop down and enter the quantity in the input field beside it.\
-You can select another product by clicking the `Add More` button and selecting another Product and entering the desired quantity.\
-Beside each product row you will find a `Serial Number` button. When you click on it, a menu opens up to the right side with as many input fields as the quantity.\
-You can enter the specification of each unit of the product here.\
-You can close the menu by again cllicking the button of the same row which will now be shown as `Selected`. But this won't save the data you entered in the menu.\
-You need to press the confirm button in the menu to save the data.\
-If the menu data is saved, a list containing all product name (and delete button) of all the confirmed products will appear right above where the menu was.\
-Deleting one element of the list will remove all the saved menu items which you can now enter again or change.\
-On clicking `Check In`, the complete data will be logged out in the console.\
-The Product,Quantity and Menu items will be shown within an array called serial.

##Note:

-You can't select the same Product twice, if you do that row get's locked.\
-You can increase the quantity as much as you desire.\
-After pressing confirm, that entire row get's saved in the list above the menu. This particular row cannot be edited unless you delete the entry from the list.\
